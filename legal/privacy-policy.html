                <p>Tech Elite Automation ("us", "we", or "our") operates the https://techeliteautomation.com website (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>

                <h2 class="content-subtitle">Information Collection and Use</h2>
                <p>We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.</p>
                
                <h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>
                <h4>Personal Data</h4>
                <p>While using our Service, primarily through our contact form, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Data"). Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Email address</li>
                    <li>First name and last name</li>
                    <li>Company name (optional)</li>
                    <li>Message content related to your inquiry</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Usage Data (Analytics)</h4>
                <p>We may also collect information on how the Service is accessed and used ("Usage Data") through Google Analytics. This Usage Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. This data is aggregated and anonymized where possible and is used to improve the functionality and user experience of our website.</p>

                <h2 class="content-subtitle">Use of Data</h2>
                <p>Tech Elite Automation uses the collected data for various purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To respond to your inquiries submitted through our contact form.</li>
                    <li>To provide analysis or valuable information so that we can improve the Service.</li>
                    <li>To monitor the usage of the Service.</li>
                    <li>To detect, prevent, and address technical issues.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="content-subtitle">Transfer Of Data</h2>
                <p>Your information, including Personal Data submitted via the contact form, is processed by EmailJS (our third-party email service provider) to deliver your message to us. We do not store your Personal Data from the contact form on our website servers.</p>
                <p>Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those from your jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to the United States for processing (e.g., via EmailJS and Google Analytics).</p>
                <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
                <p>Tech Elite Automation will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information.</p>

                <h2 class="content-subtitle">Disclosure Of Data</h2>
                <h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
                <p>Tech Elite Automation may disclose your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To comply with a legal obligation</li>
                    <li>To protect and defend the rights or property of Tech Elite Automation</li>
                    <li>To prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service</li>
                    <li>To protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public</li>
                    <li>To protect against legal liability</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="content-subtitle">Security of Data</h2>
                <p>The security of your data is important to us. Our website uses HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between your browser and our server. For data submitted via our contact form, we rely on the security measures implemented by EmailJS. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security, as no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>
                <p>Please refer to our <a href="/security-practices.html">Security Practices</a> page for more information on the measures we take to secure our website.</p>

                <h2 class="content-subtitle">Service Providers</h2>
                <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service ("Service Providers"), to provide the Service on our behalf, or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</p>

                <h2 class="content-subtitle">Links To Other Sites</h2>
                <p>Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us (e.g., GitHub). If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.</p>
                <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

                <h2 class="content-subtitle">Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our records.</p>

                <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>
